I desperately needed a portfolio website, so I buckled down and figured I'd challenge myself.

This website is written on top of Node.js, using AngularJS and Express. I scaffolded using Yeoman's angular-fullstack generator and wrote most of the Angular, styling, and whatnot myself. I also make use of D3 for chart animations, because I figured I'd need D3 at some point in the future and it'd be a useful API to know how to use.

The plan's to make a random game or scene show up at the top of the page that you can interact with! Lots is still being worked on, most notably scalability (mobile is kind of buggy.) Otherwise, I'm marching onwards with this! :)
