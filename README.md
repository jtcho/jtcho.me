jtcho.me portfolio website
==========================

This is the source code for my in-development portfolio website. :)
I've got some ambitous ideas lined up, woo~
My first thought when I started this project was: "Let's try to do something challenging." (Relatively speaking, of course.)
Hopefully this turns out well!
