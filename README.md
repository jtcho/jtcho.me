This website is written on top of Node.js, using AngularJS and Express. I scaffolded using Yeoman's angular-fullstack generator and wrote most of the Angular, styling, and whatnot myself. I also make use of D3 for chart animations.

I desperately needed a portfolio website, so I buckled down and figured I'd challenge myself. I learned a lot about AngularJS and JS-stack development these past couple weeks! (as well as pixel art/sprite animations in CSS...)
